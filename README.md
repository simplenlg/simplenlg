SimpleNLG
=========

SimpleNLG is a simple Java API designed to facilitate the generation of Natural Language. It was originally developed by Ehud Reiter, Professor at the [University of Aberdeen's Department of Computing Science](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/index.php) and co-founder of [Arria NLG](https://www.arria.com). The [discussion list for SimpleNLG is on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/simplenlg).

SimpleNLG is intended to function as a "[realisation engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realization_(linguistics))" for [Natural Language Generation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation) architectures, and has been used successfully in a number of projects, both academic and commercial. It handles the following:

* Lexicon/morphology system: The default lexicon computes inflected forms (morphological realisation). We believe this has fair coverage. Better coverage can be obtained by using the [NIH Specialist Lexicon](http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lexicon/current/web/) (which is supported by SimpleNLG).
* Realiser: Generates texts from a syntactic form. Grammatical coverage is limited compared to tools such as [KPML](http://www.fb10.uni-bremen.de/anglistik/langpro/kpml/README.html) and [FUF/SURGE](http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/surge/index.html), but we believe it is adequate for many NLG tasks.
* Microplanning: Currently just simple aggregation, hopefully will grow over time.

Current release (English)
-------------------------
The current release of SimpleNLG is V4.5.0 ([API](http://simplenlg.github.io/simplenlg/javadoc/index.html)). The "official" version of SimpleNLG only produces texts in English. However, versions for other languages are under development, see the Papers and Publications page and [SimpleNLG discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/simplenlg) for details.

Please note that earlier versions of SimpleNLG have different licensing, in particular versions before V4.0 cannot be used commercially.

Getting started
---------------
For information on how to use SimpleNLG, please see the [tutorial](https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg/wiki/Section-0-â€“-SimpleNLG-Tutorial) and [API](http://simplenlg.github.io/simplenlg/javadoc/index.html).

The quickest way to use SimpleNLG is to add it as a dependency to your maven `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>uk.ac.abdn</groupId>
  <artifactId>SimpleNLG</artifactId>
  <version>4.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```
