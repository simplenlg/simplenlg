</head>
<body>
<p>This package contains the necessary classes for running the
morphology processor for the English language. It contains the main
processor plus a helper class containing some simple morphology rules.
The best situation is to have a lexicon that handles inflection. The
rules given here are only used if the lexicon does not exist or does not
contain the desired inflection. As the English language is quite large
with countless exceptions, the morphology rules contain only the basic
inflections for words that follow distinct patterns.</p>
